# Sliding Puzzle Game

Installation steps :
1. Open the index.html in browser of your choice ( Tested with Chrome )
2. Click on "New Game" and Enjoy the Game

Note: The game would use some of your localStorage capabilities of your browser

Functionalities:

1. Displaying the time elapsed. 
2. Showing the list of moves where each move stores the tile along with its initial position and final position.
3. Refreshing the page would return the game to its last state
4. Click on shuffle to shuffle the game in an animated state 
5. Click on auto solve to auto-solve the puzzle ( step by step animation is shown )
6. JS File < index.js > is built in a generic way for any grid box, shown here is 4*4, however corresponding changes in index.css and index.html would be required

Assumptions made:

1. The Shuffle function would do a maximum of 50 swaps ( can be extended in coden - hardcoded as of now , but would require more memory for more number of swaps - can support upto browser custom memory size )
